title: Smarter Fashion Through Data
---
A few months ago H&M released a collaboration collection with Maison Martin Margiela.  Despite significant hype, the collection tanked.  I've read numerous opinion articles that offer explanations to why the collaboration failed, but I have one idea that could have avoided the catastrophe of an unsuccessful line before it's even released.  Companies should be using data to make better decisions regarding designer collaborations.

Here's what H&M could have examined before they were forced to slash the prices on a failing Margiela collection in areas outside of NYC:

1. The strategy that H&M used was to pick best selling pieces from previous Margiela collections and then re-create them for the H&M customer.  The fundamental beliefs of the Margiela customer varies starkly with the fundamental beliefs of the H&M customer.  The Margiela customer is slow, buys less, is intellectual, and appreciates design.  The H&M customer is fast, buys a lot frequently, and isn't necessarily design focused.  H&M should have known this and examined how it would affect sales.

2. The number of online mentions by bloggers didn't translate into sales.  Marketing and PR campaigns can only take a collection so far.

3. H&M could have predicted sales and customers better by looking at data on recent Margiela markdowns on sites like Yoox, Barney's, and Net-a-Porter.  They could have also looked at online buzz and run affinity analysis on their target market.

My guess is that H&M did some of that, but the tools available today fall short.  That's why we're building a custom prediction algorithm from the ground up.  Keep watching.  We're about to reverse trend forecasting.
