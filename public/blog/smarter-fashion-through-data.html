	<h3><a href="">Smarter Fashion Through Data</a></h3>
<p>A few months ago H&amp;M released a collaboration collection with Maison Martin Margiela.  Despite significant hype, the collection tanked.  I've read numerous opinion articles that offer explanations to why the collaboration failed, but I have one idea that could have avoided the catastrophe of an unsuccessful line before it's even released.  Companies should be using data to make better decisions regarding designer collaborations.</p>

<p>Here's what H&amp;M could have examined before they were forced to slash the prices on a failing Margiela collection in areas outside of NYC:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The strategy that H&amp;M used was to pick best selling pieces from previous Margiela collections and then re-create them for the H&amp;M customer.  The fundamental beliefs of the Margiela customer varies starkly with the fundamental beliefs of the H&amp;M customer.  The Margiela customer is slow, buys less, is intellectual, and appreciates design.  The H&amp;M customer is fast, buys a lot frequently, and isn't necessarily design focused.  H&amp;M should have known this and examined how it would affect sales.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of online mentions by bloggers didn't translate into sales.  Marketing and PR campaigns can only take a collection so far.</p></li>
<li><p>H&amp;M could have predicted sales and customers better by looking at data on recent Margiela markdowns on sites like Yoox, Barney's, and Net-a-Porter.  They could have also looked at online buzz and run affinity analysis on their target market.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>My guess is that H&amp;M did some of that, but the tools available today fall short.  That's why we're building a custom prediction algorithm from the ground up.  Keep watching.  We're about to reverse trend forecasting.</p>
